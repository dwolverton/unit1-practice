      <p class="overview">Hi! I'm the Grand Circus mascot, and I'm a chicken. I love Grand Circus' vision that anyone can be a developer if they have the drive and the right support. And that means you! You might see me occasionally helping with slide presentations and labs during bootcamp.</p>
      
      <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
      <p>I had heard about coding, but I never considered that it might be something a bird like me could get into. I had done a little bit of website building for a class in school back on the farm. But it really wasn't until I met the folks at Grand Circus that I realized how engaging coding can be!</p>
      <p>I showed up at Grand Circus one day for a party and I never left. I found that if I didn't give up I could solve about any problem. And I got a lot of help from my friends there. Now I love helping other folks start their coding journey!</p>
